        <h1>WORM PRT POWER CLASSIFICATIONS AND RATINGS</h1>
        <p>
            The setting of Worm is one of the most prominent superhero worlds in modern fiction, and a portion of that fame is thanks to the unique and comprehensive power classification system used in the setting. <br>
            <br>
            This site is dedicated to to giving a quick little explainer for all the power classes and the ratings system used, going over mechanics, functional use, and the response they incur.
