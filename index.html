        <h1>WORM PRT POWER CLASSIFICATIONS AND RATINGS</h1>
        <p>
            The setting of Worm is one of the most prominent superhero worlds in modern fiction, and a portion of that fame is thanks to the unique and comprehensive power classification system used in the setting. <br>
            <br>
            This site is dedicated to to giving a quick little explainer for all the power classes and the ratings system used, going over mechanics, functional use, and the response they incur.
        </p>

            and the accompanying number ratings are used by the PRT to quickly identify parahuman threats and strategize accordingly, although the system is used in non-American countries as well, including capes in India. Each classification is matched with a number indicating severity, where higher numbers mean a greater threat to public safety. <br>
            <br>
            In theory, power classifications are only intended to rate the threat posed by the power itself, and not the user's own skill or any other factors. Power classifications are also not intended to rate the "power levels", usefulness, or raw strength of
            an ability; only measuring the threat the power poses to PRT personnel and civilians. However, in practice they are often used poorly, or simply to cut through "red tape" and justify treating a parahuman a certain way. <br>

        <div class="box">
            <span class="cap">Ratings</span><br>
            The numbers assigned to classifications are not an indication of raw strength of an ability. Rather, the number rating is a ballpark scale indicating the threat to a team. As such, the numbers also take into account the possibility of harm, but also panic. <br>
            <br>
            Exceptionally high or low degrees of control are important to take into account: The first for the possibility of targeting specific team members or civilians, the second for the dangers of collateral damage or aftereffects. <br>
            <br>
            While the number scale starts at one and rises up with no hard limit (still, 10+ are rare and denote very exceptional powers), it's also possible to receive a rating of zero, or even a negative rating. <br>
            <br>
            It is the responsibility of PRT operatives and parahumans to familiarize themselves with the current ratings for all relevant threats.

                            Poses a threat only just above human norms, an unexceptional individual may be able to cope with the ability or walk away unharmed from an altercation where the abilities in question were leveraged.

                        <br>
                        <li>
                            The ability should be assumed to be a non-threat and need not be identified if other matters prove more pressing.

                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            An alert, exceptional, well-equipped, or trained 
                            individual should be able to answer or address the ability in question, but it can still prove problematic.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> 
                            Team members are reminded of standard countermeasures and should put these measures in effect when there are no pressing other matters.

                            Civilians, even alert or fit civilians, will not be able to handle the ability (or abilities) in question.

                            Several trained individuals may be required to deal with the situation.

                        <li>
                            Care should be taken to remove civilians from the area and discourage them from participating.

                        <li>
                            One full squad of trained operatives should be able to deal with this situation alone, but exceptional circumstance, context and environment may bias things one way or the other.

                            Parahumans should engage in pairs or trios at a minimum, two fully equipped squads should be deployed.

                        <li>
                            Parahumans should engage only when supported by their team to ensure a minimum of complications or danger.
